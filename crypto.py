        **What is the Fear & Greed Index?**  
        It is a way to gauge stock market movements and whether stocks are fairly priced. The logic is that **excessive fear drives prices down** (opportunity), and **too much greed drives them up** (correction risk).

        **How is it Calculated? (Official vs Proxy)**  
        - *Official (CNN)*: Compiles 7 indicators (Momentum, Strength, Breadth, Options, Junk Bonds, Volatility, Safe Haven).  
        - *Our Proxy*: We rely primarily on **Volatility (VIX)** and **Market Momentum** due to real-time data availability.

        **Scale:**  
        - **0-25**: Extreme Fear 🥶  
        - **25-45**: Fear 😨  
        - **45-55**: Neutral 😐  
        - **55-75**: Greed 😎  
        - **75-100**: Extreme Greed 🤑
